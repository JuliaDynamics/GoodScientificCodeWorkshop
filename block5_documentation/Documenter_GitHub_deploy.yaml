# Now this is where things focus on the documentation
# build and deployment.

# IMPORTANT! If your documentation is for a Julia package,
# with formal Julia package structure (`src` folder and top level Project.toml)
# then you need to include this extra step (simply uncomment it):

      # - name: Develop local package
      #   run: julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(path="."); Pkg.instantiate()'

# The next steps continue with the `doc` folder build.

      # This is really all you care about; 2-steps process
      # step 1, assumming the documentation Project.toml file is in `docs` folder
      - name: Install docs dependencies
        run: julia --project=docs/ -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
      # step 2 (note project path remains the same!)
